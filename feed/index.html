<p id="80b0">What could possibly justify the hype and asset bubble surrounding cryptographic assets? Some believe crypto signals a shift in technological and economic paradigms, and a new industrial era. So: we had the ages of Steam, Steel, Petroleum, Information, and now…Crypto? Joel Monegro and Chris Burniske have argued as much in their thesis for Placeholder Ventures. I’ve questioned that analysis — not based on the technology’s history-changing potential — but instead, looking at its timing. In other words, is it 1994, when Netscape was founded? Or, is it 1976, when the first microcomputer operating system was introduced?</p>

<p id="d5b4">Even greater skepticism is warranted for so-called “security tokens.” At New Alchemy, the question we ask is, “Why does this token need to exist?” <strong>So, why do security tokens need to exist? </strong>There are several reasons.</p>

<p id="383a">First of all, it will be helpful to stop calling them “security tokens.” <mark>These so-called security tokens are smart contracts that function as financial instruments: they may convey the same rights that come with ownership, for example, as a stock certificate or a bond may do.</mark> The Brooklyn Project, a financial data provider in crypto assets, is right to point out that the term “security token” is really only useful in the context of US securities law, which may not apply to all these instruments. The term, “Investment Token,” which the Brooklyn Project has put forward, is better, but we prefer “financial token.” These are financial instruments that may convey various forms of ownership, including direct, indirect, and shared ownership. “Investment” is likely to be apt in most cases, but it may not always be the best term to use.</p>

<p id="adaf">So, why bother with financial tokens? The existing set-up for investing in securities and trading them seems to work pretty well. There are two primary reasons:</p>

<h2 id="19ee"><strong>Liquidity:</strong></h2>

<p id="c494">Investors who buy private equity shares in a startup or a growing company often expect to wait up to 10 years to exchange those shares for cash or publicly traded stock. As appetite for private equity has grown, that timeline has grown, too: Successful firms tap private equity markets for capital in late stages that once would have been financed through an IPO. With those longer waits to liquidity, secondary markets have emerged, supporting trade in privately held companies. Tokenization could support a much more liquid and efficient secondary market. Securities law permits investment contracts sold pursuant to the Regulation D exemption to be traded with unaccredited investors under certain circumstances, after a 12-month holding period. Efforts are under way to set up a secondary market for financial tokens when they may become tradable and investors may be willing to waive some of the liquidity premium they’d otherwise demand, in anticipation that those efforts will bear fruit.</p>

<h2 id="c022"><strong>Fractional Ownership:</strong></h2>

<p id="9f95">Simply put, tokens hold out the promise of supporting many owners for a single asset, where before it was practical only to have one. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>a single piece of real estate</li>
 	<li>a single share in an OTC-listed company (shares are decimalized on the big board, but not on OTC markets)</li>
 	<li>a single line of business or balance-sheet asset inside a larger company</li>
</ul>

<p id="65e2">Mechanisms exist today to accomplish some of these forms of fractionalization, but none are efficient enough to be widely used.</p>

<p id="084c">New Alchemy believes the greatest potential may be in real estate, as a fractional form of access to real estate investing that is more nimble and less costly than a REIT. We are close to launching a real estate portfolio strategy that has been a long time and a great deal of study in the making.</p>

<p id="008a">You may have heard people talking about going “long Manhattan and short Brooklyn.” This is a possibility, but shorting an asset implies margin. With mere liquidity in the realm of potential, margin seems a long way off. In our view, tokenization will make wealth available to a broader set of investors by reducing expenses and increasing liquidity. The long-term effect, driven by these factors, will likely include the ability to parse assets that were once monolithic: investing in the iPhone, but not the Apple Watch, for example — or, indeed, Manhattan but not Brooklyn.</p>


<hr class="wp-block-separator" />


<p id="c1ac">There are other advantages, but none so compelling as liquidity and fractionalization. For example, tokenization may reduce the time and costs associated with clearance, settlement, reporting and compliance. They can efficiently provide distributions on a monthly basis (or other timing tied specifically to the revenue source), rather than the semi-annual cadence typical of bond offerings. They may be interoperable, enabling asset-for-asset exchange rates and trades, rather than trading through a currency.</p>

<p id="47db">Ultimately, even increasing liquidity is an incremental innovation. It is likely to bring in new assets in the thousands and capital in the trillions. But it’s simply a more efficient way to do what a large portion of the world is already doing.</p>

<p id="a58d">Having worked on successful projects in the first wave of widespread crypto-asset issuance, we’re aware at New Alchemy that there is a more disruptive opportunity. Decentralized networks, supported by blockchain-based consensus and a cryptographic asset that sets incentives, represent a new way to organize people, information and capital. The assets themselves represent a new form of value capture. Warren Buffett’s moats do indeed start to look Medieval.</p>

<p id="6d36">But history shows that whenever a new technology paradigm comes along, existing industries also benefit. Manufacturers of trains and ships adopted Henry Ford’s assembly line. Oil and gas companies are beginning to use Google’s enterprise data services.</p>

<p id="0862">The same thing is beginning to happen with blockchain technology, as legacy systems adopt some of the technology and features of the new paradigm. Such projects may in some cases be moving beyond window-dressing and PR stunts, and into the realm of practical application. Oracle, for example, has taken its efficiency-focused blockchain offering past its pilot stage with a handful of customers in supply chain logistics and in banking back-office operations.</p>

<p id="7ead">Soon, many companies will begin to use blockchain technology in a more universal way: to raise capital. This will not be a so-called “disruptive” innovation. For-profit corporations issuing stocks and bonds, funds investing in real estate and alternative assets — these entities are unlikely to embrace decentralization. Nonetheless, at New Alchemy, we believe it will be a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity, as both emerging asset classes and existing asset classes trade in more liquid and efficient markets. We concur with US broker-dealer David Weild, and others, who have suggested that tokenization may bring back micro- and even so-called nano-cap stock issuance that has fled the US market. Many issuers will embrace tokenization, and we’re working to provide the technology and knowhow that make it profitable for them to do so.</p>

<p id="215d"><em>Security Tokens are new tools for reducing costs while raising investment capital, and they present immediate opportunities for a broad variety of industries. In our previous article in this Security Token series, we introduced Security Token Offerings as the culmination of blockchain technology, token sales, and the traditional US securities regulatory framework. In this article, we look through history at a catastrophic financial period to understand why a securities compliant token represents both consumer protection and opportunity.</em></p>


<hr class="wp-block-separator" />


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">Blockchain technology might be in its “90s internet phase” but the token market is definitely more like the ‘roaring 20s’.</blockquote>

<p id="b155">Innovation. Speculation. Pump-and-dump. Market Manipulation.</p>

<p id="250a">If you think we’re talking about the ‘the great ICO craze’ of 2017, take pause. The ‘roaring 1920s’ are what first gave meaning to many of these terms. The economy grew 42 percent during that decade. The number of shares traded per day doubled to 5 million. Get-rich-quick schemes had everyone’s attention and wealth and excess were the way of life.</p>

<p id="2716">And then came ‘Black Tuesday’, October 29, 1929—the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12 percent and share prices on the New York Stock Exchange completely collapsed, driving the country into the Great Depression. It was a spectacular fail, made possible only because the stock market had grown so irrationally (at 20 percent annually!) in the several years before. This financial bubble did not occur without reason, nor without plenty of warnings. Even president Herbert Hoover, while serving as Secretary of commerce in 1925, “noted the ‘growing tide of speculation’ in the stock market of that era.”</p>

<p id="23ca">Hoover went on to serve as president during the Great Depression, and he bore much of the public’s blame; but no one person can cause an economic collapse of this scale. It takes systemic failures by the government and banking industry, for sure, but also by companies, media organizations, and investors. In other words, everybody.</p>

<h2 id="5bd8">Innovation. Manipulation. Misinformation.</h2>

<p id="fa15">One contributing factor to the unbridled growth of the stock market leading up to Black Tuesday was innovation — both in technology, and in finance. Advancements in generating electricity, as well as in macromolecular chemistry, were used to radically increase manufacturing output throughout the 1920s. The stock brokers working during this time had their own breakthrough: allowing customers to buy on margin.</p>

<p id="0af7">All of a sudden, individual investors were given the option to borrow and invest ~700% more than they actually had. Plus, they had the luxury of investing in a market which, they were told, “had reached a permanently high plateau.” People from all walks of life were investing on margin in the stock market during what became known as the “Roaring Twenties.”</p>

<p id="a348">The stocks they were investing in, congressional hearings later found, were heavily manipulated, a second contributing factor for the boom and bust. A rampant form of manipulation during this time involved groups called “stock pools”. A group of wealthy investors and or stock brokers would cultivate a following of less-informed traders, then use that “pool” to perform schemes like a “Pump-and-dump.”</p>

<p id="9e67">A third contributing factor to the Big Crash was inadequate technology and regulations for banks and exchanges. For instance, checks were being counted as reserves before clearing, so funds were double-counted. There were also some companies which provided incomplete and misleading financial statements.</p>

<p id="d87f">In a perfect world, financial documents would be complete and truthful; but in the 1920s, it was nearly impossible for an investor to tell whether the reports they were receiving from their investments were complete and true, because there were no standards. Following the crash in 1929, these inaccuracies in financial reporting and organized manipulation of the stock markets were investigated by Congress, and those hearings showed widespread, organized fraud and misinformation occurring in the stock market which had come to be synonymous with the American success story.</p>

<p id="34af">This story led to Congress enacting new securities laws (including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to protect the world economy, as well as US investors. A key theme of these laws was information—To require companies and stock brokers to provide accurate information. This ensured that investors would have the data they needed to make informed investment choices. These new securities regulations were also made to help ensure that companies and individuals could be held responsible if they broke laws against the types of manipulation and fraud which contributed to the financial crisis in 1929.</p>


<hr class="wp-block-separator" />


<p id="7616">If you’ve had a building sense of foreboding through our little history lesson, you’re not very far off the mark. The Token Market over the last year has resembled the exuberant stock market of the 20s. The heady mix of innovation, manipulation and misinformation at the heart of ‘Black Tuesday’, in some way, exists today. The double-digit returns for some early contributors involved in token sales has led to many others having stars (or “to the Moon”) in their eyes.</p>

<p id="d7a5">Meanwhile, Market regulators like the SEC, CFTC and other agencies are increasingly examining how to oversee the markets for digital tokens. Multiple agencies have issued warnings relating to token sales, describing many of the same schemes and forms of manipulation that the Securities laws attempted to address, such as pump-and-dumps. In addition to manipulation, there is concern that not all token projects are fulfilling the goals they describe in their whitepapers, as revealed in a paper titled “Coin-Operated Capitalism.”</p>

<p id="58d1">Those who call themselves “cryptocurrency investors” might have more tolerance for risk and huge crashes like in 1929—several have already occurred for Bitcoin. Other crypto-entrepreneurs and token projects view regulators’ warnings about token sales and their attempts to regulate the space as a move to stifle innovation and free markets.</p>

<p id="dc9c">But, consider just how much these markets resemble the 1920s and just how many everyday folks bought into token sales and cryptocurrency at the peak of the bull run in December 2017. CFTC, SEC, FINRA, NFA, and other financial regulators are charged with protecting markets. If these problems are left unaddressed, we very well might have a day like Black Tuesday in our future.</p>

<h2 id="9f23">Enter Security Tokens</h2>

<p id="cc60">Security Token Offerings, in contrast to most token sales which have occurred, are sold in accordance with securities regulations (such as Regulation A+, CF or D ) . However, many of these STOs can only be offered to accredited investors. Because of this, a few companies that have issued STOs have received negative comments from the token sales and cryptocurrency investing community.</p>

<p id="948e">For example, Sia Tech is a distributed file storage token project which issued an STO for their “Siafund” token, in conjunction with the creation of their network’s “Utility Token,” Siacoin. Because the sale of Siafund tokens was only available to accredited investors (using Regulation D exemptions), the cryptocurrency community-at-large, according to the blog CryptoGazette, “felt betrayed” by Sia’s “capitulating to the authorities.”</p>

<p id="6bed">Sia might have garnered some negative attention from the Crypto Gazette, but by deciding to design their token sale with compliance in mind, they may have ensured a better future for their business. Since they explicitly followed securities regulations and provided the necessary materials, such as their Private Placement Offering Memorandum, investors view their token as a regulation-compliant security, which in turn offers Sia some protection.</p>

<p id="52d2">Consider Ripple as being in an arguably less enviable alternative situation to Sia’s. Ripple has now been served with three class action lawsuits pertaining to their issuance of XRP, which some investors say constitutes an issuance of a security. The suits all generally claim that people bought XRP from Ripple expecting certain returns, and so they are suing Ripple on behalf of all purchasers of XRP for the lost profits.</p>

<p id="6e1d">These are legal suits which, arguably, Sia’s STO is less susceptible to, because they proactively designed their sale to comply with existing regulations. Instead, Ripple is embroiled in claiming that their sale “doesn’t meet the standards” for a security, and so have hired a, presumably expensive, legal team (including former SEC chair Mary Jo White) to defend themselves.</p>

<p id="5296">How these suits facing Ripple (as well as other similar cases) progress in the next few years is anybody’s guess. But one thing is clear—More clarity over when an asset is considered a security by the SEC is needed by the community, investors and issuers alike. At a recent public hearing by the House Committee on Agriculture, Chairman K. Michael Conway opened by saying:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">“Perhaps no question has generated greater uncertainty than how to determine if a particular token is a security…Congress and regulators may want to consider developing a new framework that takes into account the diverse characteristics and unique economic relationships embedded in the many types of digital assets that can be represented by tokens.”</blockquote>

<p id="73a4">As the story of the roaring 20’s (and the subsequent crash) illustrated though, making major revisions to laws on how investment capital is raised takes time. For token projects wishing to raise investment capital in the United States in the immediate future, Security Token Offerings are the prudent path. And that might very well be what keeps us away from the brink of a second ‘Black Tuesday’, at least in the near future.</p>

<p id="5fb6">STO stands for Security Token Offering; an elegant, complex, and infinitely promising new instrument for raising capital and distributing wealth. It’s piqued the interest of Wall Street players and is becoming particularly popular amongst more traditional issuers and investors, leading speculators to already proclaim 2020 as the “year of Security Tokens.”</p>

<p id="7ceb">Breathless fawning about the next new ‘blockchain’ phenomenon aside, STOs really are the biggest innovation in the world of securities, since securities were the biggest innovation in finance (credit the 13th century Venetians!). The potential scale is immense, with an estimated trillion-dollar securities tokenization market. Some evangelists even claim these securities could prove to be so efficient and popular that OTC markets and traditional stock exchanges might cease to exist as we know them, over the next decade.</p>

<h1 id="1e47">So, what are security tokens and what makes them so special?</h1>

<p id="cc48">Security tokens — also called tokenized securities — are tokens that behave like securities. <em>(Just in case you’re starting at the ground floor, securities are financial assets, like stocks, bonds, investment contracts, etc., that hold some type of monetary value.)</em> They can provide a range of financial rights to an investor, such as equity, or a share in the profits of an underlying business, which are coded into a smart contract on a blockchain.</p>

<p id="6388">The genius of the emerging security token ecosystem lies in combining the traditional regulatory framework for securities with the core efficiencies of blockchain. The result? A securities market with increased liquidity, lower costs, fractionalization of larger assets and greater market efficiency. Many companies and institutions are actively developing infrastructures for issuing security tokens, some with a goal of creating more inclusivity for enterprises which have not ordinarily been able to raise capital.</p>

<p id="2c58">Security tokens find favor with institutional investors for their recognizable structure, and with crypto investors for their technological innovations. All in all, growing the entire securities market.</p>

<p id="cd1f">Tokenizing securities means lowering costs for issuers, but also improving efficiency for automated traders and intelligent trading assistants. When revenue streams or lock-out periods are managed using blockchain technology (instead of paper), the mundane can become incredible. What was once static and cost-prohibitive, is now fluid and cost-effective.</p>

<p id="9146">To truly understand the marvel that is securities tokens, it’s essential to understand how we got here — to recognize the four separate blockchain revolutions that made tokenized securities possible.</p>

<h1 id="d4ea"><strong>How bitcoin pizza paved the way for security tokens</strong></h1>

<p id="99e4">A common misconception among those just starting to learn about blockchain technology is that it is only a “distributed ledger” useful for facilitating transactions of a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is to blame (or credit?). As the most widely-known cryptocurrency, and one that was first to introduce the “blockchain” system to maintain ownership records, Bitcoin is often where people start when they try to understand the concept of blockchain.</p>

<p id="f6c8">We won’t go into how Bitcoin builds on blockchain technology (here’s a great primer) but Bitcoin, and more specifically <strong>the distributed ledger technology it implemented, was the first Blockchain Revolution. </strong>It solved the problem of exclusively controlling a digital asset without an intermediary. If anyone needs a working proof of this ‘holy grail’ solution, they only need to look at the last 10 years and the people and businesses that have used Bitcoin.</p>

<p id="d408"><strong>Smart Contracts were the second Blockchain Revolution</strong>. The term and idea was proposed by Nick Szabo in 1994, but it took until 2014 for Bitcoin-enthusiast Vitalik Buterin and the other founding members of today’s second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, to make it a reality. Smart contracts are really just software code that includes certain terms, trigger events or dates, etc to automatically implement agreements. All parties can publicly and freely verify the details of the smart contract, and once the terms of the agreement are met, the contract automatically reconciles — all without an intermediary.</p>

<p id="a38e">The Ethereum team made this possible by, essentially, expanding what computers could be tasked with, beyond recording transactions, as they mined Ether on the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone with the necessary permissions and amount of Ether can initiate or interact with a smart contract by sending a transaction to the address where it’s stored on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<p id="33df">One popular use of smart contracts is the creation of <strong>Tokens, the third Blockchain Revolution.</strong> On the Ethereum blockchain, for instance, any user with the prerequisite amount of Ether can initiate an “ERC-20” smart contract (even users who can’t program), which in effect mints programmable ERC-20 tokens that are totally unique to that smart contact, and can be traded with other users on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<p id="73bb">Tokens are a fungible, irreproducible digital asset stored on a blockchain whose ownership can be maintained with 3rd party wallet applications (by users) or with proprietary software (by businesses and exchanges). Tokens, whether ERC-20 or others on different blockchains (such as the Waves platform) are the tools which allowed for <strong>the fourth Blockchain Revolution: Token Sales</strong> — Generating and selling tokens in exchange for cryptocurrency.</p>

<p id="ef9d">As part of this fourth revolution, entrepreneurs and startups sold dizzying amounts of tokens — More than 1700 token sales collected over $15 billion — since the beginning of 2017. Along with this success came scams and busts, and starting in 2017, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began to push for regulation and give guidance on when token sales involving US citizens are really securities offerings.</p>

<p id="6a74">Which brings us to Securities Tokens.</p>

<h1 id="6fc1">From Token Sales to STOs</h1>

<p id="47b4"><strong>Security Tokens use much of the same blockchain infrastructure as Token Sales, but are sold and designed with compliance in mind. </strong>This entails following legal restrictions for sales, and in many cases, working with a broker-dealer.</p>

<p id="91bf">The thing to note with the coming STO ‘revolution’ is that it isn’t so much about the technical innovations as it is about the efficiency gains — by removing middlemen, executing deals faster and automating service functions. All of this is bolstered by the same technical infrastructure and industry that has given us the last four blockchain revolutions.</p>

<p id="4d95">STOs could someday see the same kind of growth that occurred for token sales in 2017, and perhaps even more. As stupefying as token sales were in 2017, they were only a fraction of the incumbent financial markets. To understand the potential of Security Token Offerings, consider this example — In the real estate industry alone, there are over $1 trillion in financial assets whose ownership could be managed using Security Tokens.</p>

<p id="126e">Every industry has a use for tokenized securities, whether to fund new ventures or manage ownership of existing ones; or, they can be used to test entirely new business models. The public sector might one day use security tokens to issue state, provincial, or federal municipal bonds; central banks could tokenize their national debt offerings. The writing on the block is clear — The future of securities, undeniably, lies within tokenization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cybersecurity has become a primary issue for practically every company these days. Organizations unacquainted with cyber-attacks and the harm it can cause fall prey to these attacks consistently. Accordingly, the most appropriate way for an organization to secure itself is to focus on proactive and comprehensive security testing techniques. The most effective testing approach to measure current security practices is known as penetration testing, also called “Pen-testing”.</p>



<h2>What is Pentesting?</h2>



<p>This method of assessing cybersecurity involves the use of various manual and automated techniques to simulate an attack on an organization’s IT systems. It should be conducted by a qualified and independent expert, sometimes referred to as an “ethical security tester”. The goal of pen-testing is to try and exploit known vulnerabilities as well as leverage the expertise of the tester to identify other weaknesses and unknown vulnerabilities in an organization’s security arrangements. This method of testing involves an active analysis of the target system for any potential vulnerabilities that could result from poor or improper system configuration, known and unknown hardware or software flaws as well as operational weaknesses in system processes. This analysis is typically carried out from the position of a potential attacker and can involve active exploitation of security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>A Penetration Test is typically an assessment of IT infrastructure, networks, and business applications to identify attack vectors, vulnerabilities, and control weaknesses. The two most common forms of penetration testing are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Application penetration testing (typically web applications), which finds technical vulnerabilities;</li>
<li>Infrastructure penetration testing, which examines servers, firewalls, and other hardware for security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Limitations</h2>



<ul>
<li>Only covers the target application, infrastructure, or environment that has been selected.</li>
<li>Focuses on exposures in technical infrastructure, it is not intended to cover all the ways in which critical or sensitive information can leak from an organization.</li>
<li>Plays only a small part (despite often including social engineering tests) in reviewing the role of the individual (often the most important element of an organization’s defense system).</li>
<li>Is only a snapshot of a system at a point in time.</li>
<li>Can be limited by legal or commercial considerations, limiting the breadth or depth of a test.</li>
<li>May not uncover all security weaknesses, for example, due to a restricted scope or inadequate testing.</li>
<li>It provides results that are often technical in nature and need to be interpreted in a business context.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Your penetration testing program should align within:</h2>



<ul>
<li>A wider security review framework (eg. ISO 27001, NIST cybersecurity framework, ISF Standard of Good Practice);</li>
<li>Technical security infrastructure (including on-going security monitoring, vulnerability assessment, malware protection, and patch management);</li>
<li>System development processes (particularly for Web applications).</li>
</ul>



<h2>Your penetration testing program should be:</h2>



<ul>
<li>Approved by appropriate business and IT management.</li>
<li>Supported by stated objectives and timelines.</li>
<li>Integrated into your underlying technical security assurance framework.</li>
<li>Reviewed regularly and kept up to date.</li>
</ul>



<h2>The scope of your penetration testing program should:</h2>



<ul>
<li>Cover all main systems, enterprise-wide;</li>
<li>Focus on critical systems;</li>
<li>Allow for the protection of any sensitive information.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Your penetration testing program should include:</h2>



<ul>

<h2>Vulnerability assessment</h2>



<p>A vulnerability assessment (sometimes referred to as ‘scanning’) is the use of automated tools to identify known common vulnerabilities in a system’s configuration. Vulnerability assessment tools scan the information system environment to establish whether security settings have been switched on and consistently applied – and that appropriate security patches have been deployed where required. Vulnerability assessments typically seek to validate the minimum level of security that should be applied and is often the precursor to more specialized penetration testing. It does not exploit the vulnerabilities identified to replicate a real attack, nor does it consider the overall security management processes and procedures that support the system. A penetration test is an ethical attack simulation that is intended to demonstrate or validate the effectiveness of security controls in a particular environment by highlighting risks posed by actual exploitable vulnerabilities. It is built around a manual testing process that is intended to go much further than the generic responses, false-positive findings, and lack of depth provided by automated application assessment tools (such as those used in a vulnerability assessment).</p>



<h2>Pen-test requirements</h2>



<p><strong>To get a certificate on CER.live, an exchange must prove that pentest complies with all necessary requirements. </strong>The final report must demonstrate that the company performed real penetration testing – this will prove the security of users’ funds and personal data. The list of requirements are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pentest must be performed on the actual version of the infrastructure. If the infrastructure has a major update it must be retested.</li>
<li>Testing must be performed on all components of the infrastructure.</li>
<li>Testing must be performed on production, not staging, or developers’ versions.</li>
<li>Penetration testing reports must include information about performed testing actions and must include all findings.</li>
<li>The company must demonstrate that all findings were fixed.</li>
<li>The company which performs penetration testing must not be affiliated with the exchange and must not have any vested interests in successful compliance.</li>
</ul>
